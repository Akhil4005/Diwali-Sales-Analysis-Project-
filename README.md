# Diwali Sales Analysis Project 🎉

This project aims to analyze the sales data during the Diwali festive season in India. The analysis involves a deep dive into customer demographics, product sales, profit margins, and much more. This project uses Python and data visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights from raw sales data.

## 📋 Project Overview

**Diwali** is one of the biggest festivals celebrated in India, and during this period, companies witness a surge in sales across various product categories. The objective of this project is to:
- Understand the customer behavior and demographics.
- Analyze product sales, revenue, and profitability.
- Identify key factors influencing sales during Diwali.
- Generate visualizations to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and the corresponding dataset, which contains various features such as:
- Customer age, gender, marital status.
- Product category, quantity sold.
- Sales, profit, and cost data.
